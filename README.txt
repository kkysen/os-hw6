## Instructions

This file should contain:

- Your name & UNI (or those of all group members for group assignments)
- Homework assignment number
- Description for each part

The description should indicate whether your solution for the part is working
or not. You may also want to include anything else you would like to
communicate to the grader, such as extra functionality you implemented or how
you tried to fix your non-working code.

## Part Descriptions

### Part 1
Part 1 is completed with the answers filled out.

### Part 2
Part 2 is completed with explanations that our kernel is working.

### Part 3
Part 3 is completed with the answers filled out.

### Part 4
Part 4 is completed with the results of our experiment and the original kernel builds.

### Part 5
Answered the questions about jiffies and HZ.

### Part 6
Completed part 6. We added the functions in kernel/sched/freezer.c and included the data
structures in multiple files, including adding some header files and editing sched.h.

### Part 7
We implemented the functions in the freezer.c folder. Some of these functions did 
not do anything because freezer is a round-robin and we are reassigning cpus. Our
script works to change our processes to the freezer scheduler.

### Part 8
TODO
